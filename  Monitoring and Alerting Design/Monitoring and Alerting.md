# ETL Pipeline Monitoring and Alerting Summary

## Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Category | KPIs |
|----------|------|
| Pipeline Performance | - Overall execution time<br>- Task-specific execution times<br>- Data processing rate (records/second) |
| Resource Utilization | - Dataproc cluster CPU and memory usage<br>- BigQuery slot utilization<br>- GCS storage usage |
| Data Quality & Volume | - Number of records processed<br>- Data validation error rate<br>- Data volume growth over time |
| API Performance | - API call success rate<br>- API response time<br>- Number of rate limit hits |
| Pipeline Reliability | - Task success rate<br>- Number of task retries<br>- Pipeline SLA compliance rate |

### Monitoring Tools

| Tool | Purpose                                  | Cost Consideration |
|------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Prometheus | Custom metrics, non-GCP components       | Open-source, cost of running infrastructure |
| Grafana | Visualization and dashboards             | Open-source, can run on same VM as Prometheus |
| Airflow's built-in monitoring | DAG and task-level metrics, SLA, sensors | Included with Airflow |


## Alerting

### Alert Definitions

| Alert | Trigger                                                      | Severity | Channel   |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Pipeline Failures | Any task in DAG fails                                        | High | PagerDuty |
| SLA Breaches | Execution time > 120% of average                             | Medium | Slack     |
| API Rate Limit Warnings | >80% (depends) of hourly API quota used                      | Medium | Slack     |
| Data Quality Issues | Error rate > 1% in processed data (error percentage depends0 | High | xMatters  |
| Resource Utilization Spikes | CPU/Memory > 90% for >15 minutes                             | Medium | Slack     |
| Data Volume Anomalies | Daily volume Â±30% from 7-day average                         | Low | Email     |

### Alerting Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Cost Consideration |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Prometheus Alertmanager | Primary alert handling | Open-source, runs on Prometheus VM |
| Grafana Alerting | Dashboard-based alerts | Included with Grafana |
| Airflow Alerts | DAG and task failure alerts | Included with Airflow |

### Incident Response

1. **On-Call Rotation**: Weekly primary and secondary responders
2.  **Runbooks**: Maintained for common issues, stored in Confluence
4. **Post-Incident Review**: Conducted after major incidents
